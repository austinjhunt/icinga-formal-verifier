********************** nuXmv 1.0.1 (2014-11-07) **********************

This is a minor release of nuXmv that provides some internals
improvements and several bug fixes.

The list of minor improvements within this release are:

- Included the low level model checking engines that participated to
  the HWMCC 2014 as replacement of the previous ones.

- Improved the conversion into SMT by avoiding memory and computation
  blow up due to expensive internal transformations to enable for the
  booleanization of finite domain expressions.

- Avoided creation of BDD variables if not needed when verifying a
  design using SMT techniques that often resulted in very expensive
  computations.

- Integrated several optimizations and improvements from the
  development version of NuSMV.

- Improved error message in batch mode for designs with infinite
  domains variables. nuXmv now exits smoothly with an error message
  and suggestions on how to verify the design instead of reporting an
  internal error.

More that 30 bugs were fixed in this version. Many thanks to those
users who reported issues, and helped improving nuXmv. Here the most
critical bug fixes are listed:

- Fixed several corner cases in the SMT encoding that prevented the
  use of IC3-like algorithms for the verification of designs with
  infinite domain variables or non-bit blasted bit-vectors.

- Fixed a crash of within the LTL bounded model checking via SMT
  reported anonymously by a nuXmv user.

- Avoided internal error for not supported operators for models with
  infinite domain variables, providing the user with more informative
  error messages.

- Fixed a bug in the translation from nuXmv to AIGER while encoding
  LTL properties and fairness constraints in the corresponding AIGER
  file.

- Fixed internal reconstruction of the counter example for k-live and
  IC3 based algorithms.

- Integrated several bug-fixes from the development version of NuSMV.
