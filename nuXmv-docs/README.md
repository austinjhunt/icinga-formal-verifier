This is version 1.0.1 of the nuXmv symbolic model checker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

nuXmv is a symbolic model checker for the analysis of synchronous
finite-state and infinite-state systems.

nuXmv extends NuSMV along two main directions:

* for the finite-state case, nuXmv features a strong verification
  engine based on state-of-the-art SAT-based algorithms

* for the infinite-state case, nuXmv features SMT-based verification
  techniques, implemented through a tight integration with MathSAT5.

nuXmv is currently licensed in binary form, for non-commercial or
academic purposes. See LICENSE.txt for details.
